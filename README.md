# GH tool demo for Golem!

## Abstract

- switching context harms productivity
- switching windows (to internet browser) may harm it as well
- let's use `gh` to never need to switch away from the terminal (vim)


## JIRA <-> GitHub integration
(current version)

- when PR is drafted -> ticked moves to `IN PROGRESS`
- when PR is merged -> ticket changes to `DONE`
- :( no way to change status to `IN REVIEW`

ðŸ‘‰ We should open PRs as soon as posible!
...but how, when no real work has been done?
...and there is no branch to commit?


## Commands

### - `whats-on-me`
Shows list of tickets assigned to me or if called with a part of the ticket key
shows the description and writes `/tmp/jira-ticket-key` and `tmp/jira-ticket-slug` files.

### - `quick-pr`
`Quick PR` does the following:
- changes current folder's repo to _master_
- pulls the latest changes
- creates new branch on top of the master
- commits empty commit with text template and allows edition
- creates draft pull request


## Prerequisities

Scripts assuemes the following commands are available in the PATH
- `git` command
- `gh` - the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) tool
- `jq` - [jq is like sed for JSON data](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- `html2text` - [html2text man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/html2text)
